    <p>In the shadows of a mysterious forest, where the lines between devotion and darkness blur, lies a culinary secret
        known only to a select few. Inspired by the twisted world of Cult of the Lamb, we bring you a dish that will
        test your resolve and tantalize your taste buds: <strong>Minced Follower Meat</strong>.</p>

    <h2 > Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong>3 Follower Meat</strong> (Harvested from deceased followers or obtained through sacrifice rituals.
            Don't worry, they won't be needing it anymore.)</li>

        <li> <strong>5 Bones</strong> (Collected from defeated enemies or follower sacrifices. Bonus points if they're
            still warm.)</li>

    </ul>
    <h2 > Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Chop the Follower Meat:</strong> Finely chop the follower meat into small, uniform pieces to ensure
            even cooking.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Crush the Bones:</strong> Use a mortar and pestle to crush the bones into a coarse powder. This will
            add texture and
            a hint of darkness to the dish. </li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Ingredients:</strong> Combine the chopped follower meat and crushed bones in a large bowl.
            Mix well to
            distribute the ingredients evenly.</li>
        </li><strong>Cooking Method:</strong> Place the mixture in a cooking pot over medium heat. Stir occasionally
        until the mixture is
        heated through. Be cautious, as this dish can be volatile.
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve hot to your followers. Be prepared for potential side effects, including
            illness and increased
            loyalty.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 > Tips </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Consider giving your followers the Cannibal Trait to mitigate negative effects and gain faith.</li>
